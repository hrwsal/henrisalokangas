            <p>Demography, 2023:60(4): 1005–1029</p>
            Abstract
            <div class="abstract-content">
                <p>This article employs a couple-level framework to examine how a child's severe illness affects within-family gender inequality. We study parental labor market responses to a child's cancer diagnosis by exploiting an event-study methodology and rich individual-level administrative data on hospitalizations and labor market variables for the total population in Finland. We find that a child's cancer negatively affects the mother's and the father's labor income. The effect is considerably larger for women, increasing gender inequality beyond the well-documented motherhood penalty. We test three potential moderators explaining the more negative outcomes among mothers: (1) breadwinner status, (2) adherence to traditional gender roles and conservative values, and (3) the child's care needs. We find that mothers who are the main breadwinner experience a smaller reduction in their household income contribution than other mothers. Additionally, working in a gender-typical industry and a child's augmented care needs reinforce mothers' gendered responses. These findings contribute to the literature by providing new insights into gender roles when a child falls ill and demonstrating the effects of child health on gender inequality in two-parent households. </p>

            <div class="abstract-content">
                <p>This paper studies the impact of long-term unemployment on physical activity. We examined the effects 6 and 15 years following a severe business cycle downturn in Finland over the period 1991–1994. The study sample comprised residents of Northern Finland. The unemployed individuals were 23–26 years old during the downturn. Physical activity, measured by MET minutes and meeting WHO guidelines, was higher 15 years later among those people who experienced the longest periods of unemployment in 1991–1994. Physical activity was somewhat lower among people with relatively shorter periods of unemployment.</p>

            Abstract
            <div class="abstract-content">
                <p>Background and Objectives: We aimed to study how five childhood adversities and trauma (CAT) core domains: emotional abuse (EmoAb), physical abuse (PhyAb), sexual abuse (SexAb), emotional neglect (EmoNeg), physical neglect (PhyNeg), associate with alcohol problems (APs), and whether there are any gender differences in these associations.
                    Methods: Altogether, 690 adult participants drawn from the general population completed a mailed questionnaire, including the trauma and distress scale, as an indicator of CAT, and questions concerning sociodemographic background, depressive symptoms, and APs.
                    Results: In univariate analyses, male gender, middle age, divorced/separated marital status and lower education, frequency of use of alcohol, previous treatment for mental problems, as well as depressive symptoms and CAT domain scores were associated with APs. Of the CAT domains, females reported more EmoAb and SexAb than males, but there was no gender difference in other CAT domains and depressive symptoms. In multivariate analyses, when the effects of background characteristics were controlled, CAT sum and all its domains had indirect effects via depressive symptoms on APs with no significant direct effect except in females, in whom PhyAb and SexAb associated directly with APs even when the effects of other CAT domains were taken into account.</p>

            <p>IZA Discussion paper series, March 2023</p>
            Abstract
            <div class="abstract-content">
                <p>Emerging strands of research have examined the family spillover effects of health shocks, usually focusing on labour market outcomes. However, the results have been inconclusive and there is only little evidence on the longer term consequences of health shocks or the mechanisms behind the spillover effects. We analyse the short- and long-term effects of cancer on the healthy spouse’s labour supply and mental health by gender and relative income status within the couple (i.e., the breadwinner type). We use full population register data on all cancer patients and their cohabiting partners in Finland over the period 1995-2019. Our identification strategy is based on the quasi-random variation in the timing of the cancer diagnosis and a dynamic difference-in-differences approach. We find two main results. First, cancer increases female spouses' employment. This result is consistent with the added worker effect, although we find the magnitude of the increase in annual earnings to be negligible. By contrast, among male spouses, earnings decrease as a consequence of a spouse's cancer. Second, among women, there is heterogeneity in the effects in terms of the breadwinner status, which is especially notable in the long-term. The results show that the added worker effect is visible only among secondary earners and the effect seems to hold only when the cancer patient dies. Secondary earner women also suffer more from psychiatric symptoms during bereavement. Consequently, we argue that the breadwinner status before the health shock is a neglected factor influencing the effects of health shocks in families, and that family-level specialisation between spouses alters substantially over time in response to a health shock.</p>

            <h4>Mental health treatment among family members of patients with cancer</h4>
            <p>IZA Discussion paper series, March 2023</p>
            Abstract
            <div class="abstract-content">
                <p>IMPORTANCE Evidence suggests that family members of patients suffering from cancer are vulnerable to poor mental health. However, the literature has not systematically compared the relative risk levels across various family relationships.

OBJECTIVE To compare the relative risk of mental health treatment among relatives of patients with cancer versus individuals without a cancer diagnosis in the family. Additionally, to compare the relative magnitudes of the risks across different family relationships, separately for childhood and adulthood cancers.

DESIGN, AND SETTING Population-based, multi-generational case-control study using Finnish data on hospital discharges, outpatient care, reimbursements for pharmaceutical purchases and biological parent-child relations.

PARTICIPANTS Spouses, children, siblings, parents, grandparents, cousins, and aunts/uncles of patients with cancer (diagnosed in Finland between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2010; N= 157,951), and matched general population control subjects (N= 477,129). 

EXPOSURES Being a family member of a patient diagnosed with cancer. 

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcomes were purchases of psychotropic medications and clinical diagnosis of psychiatric disorders through hospital-based inpatient care or specialized outpatient care. Flexible parametric models and Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% CIs. All models were adjusted for sex, age, birth year, and province of residence at birth.

RESULTS During the 10-year follow-up, the risk of psychotropic medication increased the most for parents of children with cancer (adjusted HR, 1.35; 95\% CI, 1.29-–1.43) and for spouses of adults with a cancer diagnosis (aHR, 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.25-–1.36). The relative risks of attending specialized psychiatric outpatient care were similar to those for psychotropic medication. However, for parents of children with cancer, the risk increased by 64\% (aHR, 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.49-–1.80). Moreover, cancer increased the risk of mental health treatment for parents and children of adults with cancer, as well as for siblings in both childhood and adulthood cancer. However, no increase in mental health treatment risk was detected in more distant family members (cousins, aunts/uncles). The risk of mental health treatment was particularly high when the cancer patient died during the 10-year follow-up.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this nationwide cohort study of approximately 690,000 Finnish residents, we observed a significant increase in the risk of mental health treatment among spouses of adult cancer patients and parents of children with cancer following the cancer diagnosis of their family members. These findings have important implications for both researchers and clinicians, underscoring the significance of addressing the secondary mental health risks associated with cancer. They highlight the importance of psychosocial support and availability of mental health services for the closest family members..</p>
